# GCode-Checker
Checks for Malicious Code in 3D-Printer GCode (Marlin Flavor) Files.
If you want to use it, just download the .exe file and you are fine. It creates a little config file in the same directory that just saves your custom printer presets, so probably put it anywhere you want in a folder and add a shortcut to it.
This is a completely free project and will always be free. If you find any bugs, let me know through reddit /u/VoltexRB.
